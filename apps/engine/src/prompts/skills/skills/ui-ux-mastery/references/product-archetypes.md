# Product Archetype Decision Matrix

Use this reference after identifying the product's primary and secondary archetypes. It converts product type into concrete UX, density, navigation, content, and interaction decisions.

## 1. Classification Dimensions

Score each dimension before selecting patterns:

| Dimension            | Low end    | High end             | Design consequence                                          |
| -------------------- | ---------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Usage frequency      | occasional | continuous           | onboarding vs efficiency and shortcuts                      |
| User expertise       | novice     | specialist           | explanation vs compact controls                             |
| Consequence of error | trivial    | severe               | speed vs verification and auditability                      |
| Data density         | sparse     | extreme              | spacious storytelling vs structured density                 |
| Task duration        | seconds    | hours                | transient flow vs persistent workspace                      |
| Collaboration        | individual | multi-role           | local state vs comments, permissions, presence              |
| Connectivity         | stable     | intermittent         | synchronous assumptions vs offline resilience               |
| Content volatility   | static     | real-time            | ordinary refresh vs visible freshness and conflict handling |
| Emotional context    | relaxed    | stressful            | expressive delight vs calm clarity                          |
| Input method         | touch      | keyboard/mouse/mixed | target size vs compact acceleration                         |

Use the score to moderate archetype defaults. A novice-facing finance app should not inherit the density of a professional trading terminal merely because both are financial.

## 2. Marketing and Editorial Experiences

### Primary jobs

- understand value;
- evaluate credibility;
- compare options;
- learn;
- convert, subscribe, contact, download, or purchase.

### Recommended structure

- concise global navigation;
- a first viewport with clear category, promise, audience, and next action;
- evidence near claims;
- progressive detail;
- direct comparison for plans or alternatives;
- persistent but non-obstructive conversion path;
- robust footer and contact routes.

### Visual implications

- typography and content carry hierarchy;
- use fewer repeated cards;
- vary rhythm between narrative, evidence, demonstration, and conversion sections;
- imagery should demonstrate the product or establish credible context;
- use motion to explain or connect, not to delay access.

### Common failures

- vague hero copy;
- fake logos or metrics;
- repetitive icon-card grids;
- aggressive popups before value is understood;
- hidden pricing or material conditions;
- decorative product mockups that reveal no real workflow.

### Quality test

After five seconds, a new visitor should know what the product is, who it is for, why it matters, and the primary next step.

## 3. Consumer Mobile Applications

### Primary jobs

- complete a focused task quickly;
- return frequently with low reorientation cost;
- receive timely, controllable updates;

- clear first-run path;
- contextual permission requests;
- strong home state based on actual next actions;
- bottom navigation where destinations are peers;
- full-screen task flows for focused operations;
- sheets for short contextual choices;
- reliable drafts and interruption recovery.

### Visual implications

- comfortable targets;
- concise labels;
- strong state visibility;
- careful safe-area and keyboard behavior;
- limited simultaneous actions;
- familiar platform controls unless differentiation is valuable.

### Common failures

- onboarding carousel with no user value;

- activity and audit history;
- keyboard accelerators.

### Visual implications

- compact density may be appropriate;
- alignment and predictable regions are more valuable than dramatic composition;
- color should emphasize exceptions, not decorate every area;
- controls should remain stable when data updates;
- use cards only when they create meaningful grouping.

### Common failures

- hiding critical controls to look minimal;
- converting tables into cards;
- ambiguous status chips;
- actions that move based on selection;
- filters that reset after navigation;
- no distinction between current, delayed, stale, and failed data;
- no partial failure handling.

### Quality test

An experienced user should complete repeated tasks with minimal pointer travel and without losing context.

## 13. Hybrid Products

Many products combine archetypes. Choose a dominant mode per screen rather than blending every convention everywhere.

Examples:

- SaaS homepage: marketing archetype.
- SaaS workspace: enterprise or creator archetype.
- Billing page: financial archetype.
- AI copilot panel: AI archetype.
- Mobile companion: consumer mobile archetype.

A coherent brand can span these modes while density and interaction adapt to the task.
